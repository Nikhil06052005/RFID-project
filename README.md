# üîç AI-Powered RFID Lost & Found System

A smart, scalable solution to track and recover lost items in real-time using **RFID, AI, and Cloud integration**.

## üö® Problem
Millions of items are lost annually in public places like airports, metros, and hotels, causing **stress, time loss, and security issues**. Traditional lost-and-found systems are manual, slow, and depend heavily on human effort.

## üöÄ Our Solution
An **AI-powered RFID system** that automates the item recovery process:

- RFID tags on items for unique identification
- ESP32 microcontroller and RFID scanner for real-time tracking
- Firebase for secure cloud storage and real-time data sync
- Web-based dashboard for instant alerts and status
- Scalable to smart campuses, public transport, malls, airports, and more
